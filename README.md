# Customer-segmentation-

Through this project, I successfully implemented clustering algorithms to segment customers based on shared attributes. The project resulted in distinct customer groups, each with its own set of preferences and behaviors. The segmented approach allowed for more targeted and personalized marketing strategies, leading to improved customer engagement and potentially higher conversion rates. This project showcased my ability to apply advanced data analysis techniques to real-world business challenges and demonstrated the value of data-driven decision-making in marketing
